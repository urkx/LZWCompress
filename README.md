# LZWCompress

Go package that implements LZW method for compress and decompress data

All contributions and corrections are welcome!

- TODO-list
    - Implement bits-variable length for output data in compression process 16 bits by default cause a ridiculous compression rate, may even cause the output data to be greater than input data.
